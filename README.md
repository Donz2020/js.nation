## Requirements

To use js.nation, you'll need a decently-powered computer and a modern browser (see below for supported browsers).
Laptops may lag a little, and phones straight-up will not work properly.

## Browser Support

For best results, we recommend the latest version of Google Chrome, as it tends to receive the most thorough testing.

All officially supported browsers are listed below (along with respective minimum required versions).

- Firefox 44
- Chrome 49

The follow browsers are *partially* supported:

- Edge 13
  - `shadowBlur` renders incorrectly and thus is disabled automatically

The following browsers are **not** supported:

- Safari (limited AudioNode support)
- Internet Explorer (no AudioNode support)

Note that running from a local filesystem (via `file://`) is **not officially supported** and may break things badly.
For best results, a local webserver should be used if possible.
